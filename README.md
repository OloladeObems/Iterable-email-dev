# Iterable-email-dev
Hey there 👋

This repository is where I keep the work I’ve done building emails inside Iterable.
It’s a mix of code, snippets, and real-life use cases—because email isn’t just about making something pretty, it’s about making it work for the customer and the brand.

**What’s Inside**

Dynamic Templates → Emails I have built for lifecycle campaigns (abandoned cart, win-back, birthday, newsletters).
Handlebars Snippets → Small pieces of code that solve common personalisation problems.
Screenshots → Because sometimes you just want to see the final email.

**Why I Built This**
I wanted a place to show how I approach email in Iterable—not just as a developer writing tables and inline CSS, but as someone who’s thinking about customer journeys, retention, and personalisation.

For me, the fun part of email development is when code + strategy come together. That’s what you’ll find here.
